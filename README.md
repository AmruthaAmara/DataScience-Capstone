# DataScience-Capstone

## Objective/Task
1) Predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.
2) Determine the cost of a launch.

## Business Problem
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 
This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
With the help of Data Science findings and models, the competing startup that has been hired by, can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Methodology
Data Collection, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Model Development, Model Evaluation and Reporting the results to respective Stakeholders.
